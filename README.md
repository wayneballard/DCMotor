## DC Motor Project

This project models and simulates a DC motor using MATLAB/Simulink.  
The report includes analysis of system dynamics, transfer function derivation, and speed control design.

### Key Results
- Derived transfer function:  
  $$ G(s) = \frac{K}{(Js + b)(Ls + R) + K^2} $$
- Implemented PI controller achievieng stable motor operation with a storng distrubance rejection.
- Implemented two control loops: current control loop and speed control loop
